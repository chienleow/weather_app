# WeatherApp

This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) App built in Ruby.

This Weather App utilizes API from https://openweathermap.org/. On start up, the app will welcome the user and ask for a US zipcode. Users can enter a valid US zipcode to view the main weather and temperature for the next 5 days. Then, users can hit any key to restart the session.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'weather_app'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install weather_app

## Usage

To run Ecommerce App from your command line, type the below and follow the on screen prompts.

```$ bin/weather```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
